<h1>Hiiiii Ashleeyy</h1>

<p>
I don’t even know where to start. I have been holding this in for way too long. Every time you are near, my heart races like it is trying to catch up with itself. I feel this nervous excitement I cannot explain, and sometimes I cannot help but look at you because you are so beautiful. Not in a flashy way, just naturally, effortlessly beautiful, like you do not even have to try.
</p>

<p>
Your smile is not just a smile. It makes everything feel lighter, and my day suddenly gets better without me even realizing it. Your personality is amazing. You are genuine, kind, and thoughtful. The little things you do, the way you laugh, the way you talk, the way you carry yourself, all of it makes me admire you so much. Sometimes I catch myself smiling for no reason and realize it is because I was thinking of you.
</p>

<p>
I always check your reposts, your Instagram and TikTok stories. Maybe it sounds silly, but it is my quiet way of feeling a little closer to you. Each update feels like a small window into your world, and I cannot help but smile seeing glimpses of who you are.
</p>

<p>
I know you are not ready for this and your mindset is focused on yourself first. I understand that completely and I respect it. I do not want to rush you, expect anything, or change you. I just want to admire you quietly and sincerely, like a secret star I can watch in the night sky.
</p>

<p>
I have thought about this a lot. I know the chances of you having a crush on me are basically zero. That is okay. I do not need you to feel the same way. I just need to say it. Keeping it inside felt heavier than finally letting it out.
</p>

<p>
I like you. Truly. I even wish I could write you handwritten letters, pouring out all the little feelings I cannot say aloud, letting ink carry what my voice cannot. But I am shy and I do not know how I would give them to you. Maybe this is enough for now, letting these words exist somewhere and quietly hoping they reach your heart in some small way.
</p>

<p>
Good luck to us on our research. If you really do not know who I am, that is okay. I am just someone who sees you, admires you, and thinks you are amazing in the simplest, truest ways.
</p>

<p>
Even from afar, I hope these words make you smile, just a little, the way you have made me smile countless times without knowing it.
